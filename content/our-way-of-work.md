# ♻️ We use a variation of the [Kanban Agile Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaFVa7HYj4): Backlog ⇒ Todo ⇒ In Process ⇒ QA ⇒ Tested ⇒ Done (Closed).

1. Everything starts at the SCRUM meeting (read about SCRUM).
2. We have Backlog of previously thought features or bug fixes ([here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/About-4Geeks-Academy/issues)).
3. During SCRUM meeting (every week), some of the features (each feature is one card, every card has written specs mutually agreed upon) from the Backlog are moved to the Todo column after careful and public discussion and consideration with the team.
4. Every card has ⭐️ P1 or ⭐️ P2 priority consideration.
5. Developers start with ⭐️ P1 by moving cards to the In progress section.
6. Once they are finished developers move the issue to the QA section do a Pull Request and ask the Technical Leader for review.
7. Once approved and [tested by the QA team](https://www.notion.so/Tutorials-Product-Roles-7c9b0425d18f465e8e424865f4d70887?pvs=21), the card is moved to tested.
8. During the next scrum, cards are cleaned by closing or moving them to the done section.
