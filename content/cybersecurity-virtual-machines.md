# Cybersecurity Virtual Machines

Aside from the publicly known [virtual machines to practice cybersecurity](https://4geeks.com/lesson/virtual-machines-for-cybersecurity) we have prepared an additional list of computers that are ideal for learning CyberSecurity:

## Kali Linux Virtual Machine

Kali Linux is a specialized Linux distribution designed for penetration testing, security research, computer forensics, and reverse engineering.

We don't have a special procedure for installing Kali Linux; we follow the standard installation process suggested on the main page. You can follow it from this project: [Installing Kali Linux on a Virtual Machine](https://github.com/breatheco-de/installing-kali-linux-on-virtual-machine/tree/main).

## Debian Virtual Machine

We have prepared a machine with Debian installed, with some basic settings that will be used during the bootcamp.  
Otherwise, it is a regular Debian machine like any other, and it will be an important space where you'll learn how to use GNU/Linux systems securely for its use in network environments as a server.

### Installing the Debian Virtual Machine

Depending on your operating system:

A) Windows and Linux computers can [download the OVA file](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb.ova) and must import it to VirtualBox to create the Debian virtual machine. It is a heavy file, so it is advisable to download it in advance to save time when doing the practice.  

B) Mac computers can [download the ISO file](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb-iso.zip) (heavier) and use UTM to `emulate` (not virtualize) the machine.
